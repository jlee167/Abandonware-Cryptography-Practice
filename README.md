# FFT_Image_Cryptography_C5502DSP
FFT Image Encryption module for C5502 DSP. Tested on C5502 Ezdsp. I currently do not have necessary connector for UART channel, and USB connection on the device is very unstable. Since there is no more support for C55x device anymore, I recommend migrating the project to another platform. CCS v7 was used.
